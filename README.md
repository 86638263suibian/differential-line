Differential Line
=============

The Differential [github] algorithm is inspired by the way a number of
biological things in nature grows. Among other things it is made to mimic the
growth of the human brain, as well as a great number of plants. In brief; we
start of with a number of connected nodes in a circle. Gradually we introduce
new nodes on the lineâ€”prioritizing segments where the curve bends more sharply.
Over time the curve grows increasingly intricate, but it never self-intersects.

If we start with a different shape, and draw the outside position of the object
for each growth step, we can get an entirely different kind of system with an
interesting 3D illusion.
