Differential Line
=============

![ani](/img/ani2.gif?raw=true "animation")

This algorithm is inspired by the way a number of biological things in nature
grows. Among other things it is made to mimic the growth of the human brain, as
well as a great number of plants.

In brief; we start of with a number of connected nodes in a circle. Gradually
we introduce new nodes on the lineâ€”prioritizing segments where the curve bends
more sharply.  Over time the curve grows increasingly intricate, but it never
self-intersects.

If we start with a different shape, and draw the outside position of the object
for each growth step, we can get an entirely different kind of system with an
interesting 3D illusion.

## Prerequisites

In order for this code to run you must first download and install these two
repositories:

*    `render`: http://github.com/inconvergent/render
*    `zonemap`: https://github.com/inconvergent/zonemap

## Other Dependencies

The code also depends on:

*    `numpy`
*    `cython`
*    `python-cairo` (do not install with pip, this generally does not work)

## Running it on Linux (Ubuntu)

To install the libraries locally, run `make`. I have only tested this code in
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but my guess is that it should work on most other platforms
platforms as well.  However i know that the scripted install in `make` will not
work in Windows

## Running it on OS X

To install on OS X, you'll need to install [OpenMP /
Clang](https://clang-omp.github.io/), and then have cc linked to that
installation. So, in the differential-line directory:

```bash
$ brew install clang-omp
$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/clang-omp /usr/local/bin/cc
$ make
$ rm /usr/local/bin/cc
```

Also, you'll need to have pygtk installed to run the included files.

```bash
$ brew install pygtk
```

You should now have a working copy installed.

## Running it on Windows?

The code will probably work just fine under Windows, but I'm not sure how to
install it. (Let me know if you get it working!)

## Why all the main files?

If you just want to try this out you should have a look at `main_ani.py`. It is
pretty safe to ignore all the others main files. (They implement different
behaviour, and some of them are very experimental.)
